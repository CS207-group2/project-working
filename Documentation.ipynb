    "\n",
    "We provide full implementations off all binary differentiable operations with dual and non-dual numbers. When we want to operate a with $u$, $ a \\circ u$, we have 4 possibities: \n",

    "4. $a$ and $u$ are both dula numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations 1 is already implemented by Python, hence we only need to implement operations 2 through 4.\n",

    "Below are the derivative formula for each operation. Dual numbers are marked as a function with a variable, e.g. $u(x)$ or $a(x)$ with ther derivative, $a^{\\prime}$ and $u^{\\prime}$. Scalars are simply labeled without variable: $a$ and $b$. \n",
